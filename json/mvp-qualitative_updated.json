    "title": "Impact on Winning and Team Dynamics",
    "prompt": "On a scale of 0 to 10 (0 being no influence, 10 being extraordinarily influential and rarely seen in NBA history), assess the player's overall impact on winning and team dynamics. This includes their direct contributions to their team's success, leadership on and off the court, and their ability to elevate teammates. Consider whether the team would likely collapse in the absence of this player. Be exceptionally critical: scores of 9 or 10 should be reserved for players whose impact defines a season or era. Always begin your answer with your rating on a scale from 0 to 10, formatted as: [[<RATING> / 10]]."

This includes compelling personal stories, milestones, or symbolic significance within the league. Consider the broader impact on fans, media, and NBA culture.

    "title": "Two-Way Excellence",
    "prompt": "On a scale of 0 to 10 (0 being one-dimensional, 10 being elite dominance on both ends of the floor), assess the player's two-way contributions. This includes offensive and defensive impact, as well as intangibles like versatility and situational adaptability.

This includes their performances in critical games, clutch plays under pressure, and their consistency against the strongest competition.
