Embiid won his first MVP award after finishing as the runner-up for the previous two seasons, which was a significant personal achievement. His dominance on the court, particularly in scoring and defense, was a major storyline throughout the season.\n",

      "Injuries and returns were also significant storylines, with players like Zion Williamson making a comeback and showing glimpses of his potential before injuries derailed his season again. Ja Morant's off-court issues and his subsequent return added drama to the narrative of his ascendant career.\n",
